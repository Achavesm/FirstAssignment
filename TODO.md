# TODO

To complete this assignment, finish the class **ReviewImpl** that implements the interface **Review** to properly pass every test under the **ReviewImplTest** class.

You may work in teams of **two** or **three** people, but it will be a **personal delivery** due on Friday 29th of September 2017.

Should you get stuck, you can check my solution out, **ProfeImpl** but only as a final resource.

Additional tests are welcome but not mandatory.

Happy coding!!!
